/* Takes an abstract floating-point value having sign `zSign', exponent `zExp',

 * point value corresponding to the abstract input.  Ordinarily, the abstract
 * value is simply rounded and packed into the single-precision format, with
 * the inexact exception raised if the abstract input cannot be represented
 * exactly.  However, if the abstract value is too large, the overflow and
 * inexact exceptions are raised and an infinity or maximal finite value is
 * returned.  If the abstract value is too small, the input value is rounded to
 * a subnormal number, and the underflow and inexact exceptions are raised if
 * the abstract input cannot be represented exactly as a subnormal single-
 * precision floating-point number.
 *     The input significand `zFrac' has its binary point between bits 30
 * and 29, which is 7 bits to the left of the usual location.  This shifted
 * significand must be normalized or smaller.  If `zFrac' is not normalized,
 * `zExp' must be 0; in that case, the result returned is a subnormal number,
 * and it must not require rounding.  In the usual case that `zFrac' is
 * normalized, `zExp' must be 1 less than the "true" floating-point exponent.
 * The handling of underflow and overflow follows the IEEE Standard for
 * Floating-Point Arithmetic.
